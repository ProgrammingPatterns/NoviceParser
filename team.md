# Hey! I'm Katie Cunningham

<img src="../katie.jpg" width="200"/>

I'm a PhD student focusing on computing education. I proposed this project and managed it over summer 2019.


# Hi! Iâ€™m Alec Minchington.

I worked on the parser code during this project. I adapted an existing parser written in Lex and Yacc to an easier-to-understand version written in Python with SLY. I also created and implemented new grammar rules in the parser. 

When I'm not working on CS education research, you may find me helping teach EECS 280 (an intro programming and data structures class), working on side projects with friends, or pursuing my other academic interest, robotics, by working on the Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles team.


# Hi! I'm Austin Lam.

I developed test cases and documentation for NoviceParser, as well as contributed to NoviceParser's design.
